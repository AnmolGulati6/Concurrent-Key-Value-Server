# Concurrent-Key-Value-Server
This project implements a concurrent Key-Value (KV) Store as a server in a client-server model. The server and client processes are multithreaded, utilizing shared memory for interprocess communication. A concurrent Ring Buffer and a shared Request-status Board in the shared memory facilitate request processing.
